# Delightful JavaScript Testing with Jest

There are several frameworks utilized today for testing your JavaScript. Each comes with its own set of features and developer preferences, but we enjoy Jest because of its lightweight and conventional setup. Out of the box it comes with very descriptive test results printed directly to your console. 

If a testing environment is complicated to set up, developers will look at it as a burden instead of a tool. Being able to get up and running quickly and seamlessly will encourage more tests! 

Jest is used by Facebook to test their React applications.
