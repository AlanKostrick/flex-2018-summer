# Feature Branches

We will be using feature branches to build out all of our content for the final project. All feature branches will be verified and
merged to master via pull requests. 

## Working rules
- Do not code on master on your local machine but if you find yourself in this position we can fix it
  - `git stash` will take all of your changes on master and remember them
  - `git checkout -b new-branch` then `git stash apply` will take these changes you had on master and place them on your new branch
- Do not add/commit/push to the master branch 

## The process
- Make a feature branch for every "feature" you plan on adding into your application
- Since we work in iterations, these should be todos from your trello cards for a particular sprint
- Name your feature branch to match the feature you are building
  - For example `git checkout -b account-and-bank-build` may be a branch that a dev creates to test and build these entities out
  - You can `add commit push` to this branch as much as you would like
  - When ready, submit the pull request on git hub
  - A teammate will verify the pull request(pr) and merge to master on git hub
  - Entire team can do a `git pull` to pull these changes into master
